Our specialised team has the skill and experience to provide a range of services. The utmost care is taken with all our work. The main streams of work we perform are as follows:

### Property

The first contact with law for many people is when buying a first home. We can assist you through this process, managing the details and offering advice. When or if the time comes, we'll also assist with selling your home.

We have expertise in the consent process for new developments and improvements, as well as helping you manage assets through trusts.
